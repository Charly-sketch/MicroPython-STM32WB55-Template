# Basic LED Toggle with MicroPython

This example demonstrates how to toggle LEDs using MicroPython on the STM32WB55.

## Description

The script initializes the GPIO pins connected to the LEDs and toggles their state. This is a simple way to control LEDs programmatically.

## Requirements

- STM32WB55 microcontroller
- MicroPython firmware installed
- LEDs connected to GPIO pins

## Usage

1. Flash the MicroPython firmware onto your STM32WB55.
2. Copy the provided script to the board.
3. Run the script to toggle the LEDs.
